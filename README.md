ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Okonofua. Welcome to my Github account.

I am a **Software Engineer** with a high sense of design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. My expertise is not just limited to utilizing a common programming language to build a web application, itâ€™s more about insight in developing ideas, project management, and strategy in design that is geared towards customer satisfaction and revenue optimization.
